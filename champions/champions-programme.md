# The Turing Reproducible Research Champions programme

All too often research is published as "Trust me, I'm a scientist": there is no
way for the reader to confirm the results that are presented.

We (Research fellow [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/kirstiej) and
lead research software engineer [Martin O'Reilly](https://github.com/martintoreilly))
want to make it the norm to share data and code alongside the written manuscript.
We want work published by Turing researchers to be regarded as a gold standard
example for data science, advancing the boundaries of what we know by providing
all the necessary evidence to verify those findings.

## What is Reproducible Research?
Reproducible research is work that can be independently verified. In practice it
means sharing the data and the code that were used to generate research
results. Without the evidence of what was done, journal articles are simply
nice, interesting stories. All readers, not just collaborators or the original
authors, must be able to check published research.

For the Turing, reproducibility ensures that the wider academic, indus˜try and
governmental communities we operate in can easily validate, replicate and build
on the work we produce. This helps us extend the Turing's impact beyond the
immediate outputs of the institute itself, providing a "force multiplier" effect
on the progress of Data Science in the UK and beyond.

With an increasing focus on the scientific "reproducibility crisis" by the
[academic](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)
and [popular](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39054778) press, as
well as by [government](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/inquiry6/),
ensuring that the Turing takes a leadership role in making research reproducible
is more important than ever.

## What is a Reproducible Research Champion?

We've selected three Turing researchers who want to take their research to the
next level in terms of reproducibility and help us establish a culture of
reproducible research at the Turing. Our three Reproducible Research Champions
are:

Each of our Champions has proposed an example of their work that they want to
“level up” in terms of reproducibility. Over the coming months, Kirstie Whitaker
and the Research Engineering Group will build up a set of resources that can be
used to reproduce the work in the selected papers. Each of the papers presents
a different challenge in terms of reproducibility, and we're really excited to
be working on such a range of projects.

As well as generating great examples of reproducible research, the programme
will capture the learning from making Champions' research reproducible as a set
of resources to support other researchers in doing the same. We will also run a
series of [weekly drop-in sessions](../comms/reproducible-research-dropin-ann.md)
to provide hands on support and advice to other researchers at the institute to
help them make their own research reproducible.

## What’s in it for the champions?

**RSE time:** Each Champion is receiving **2-4 weeks of RSE support** from
one of the Turing's Research Software Engineers (RSEs) to make their chosen
paper a great example of reproducible research.

**Publicity:** The Turing Communications team will work with each champion to
publicise their work as part of a widespread and high-profile publicity campaign
highlighting reproducible research best practice at the institute.

## What’s in it for the Turing?

**Impact:** One of the Turing's goals is to increase the impact of data science
research and ensuring that the institute's research reproducible is a key
part of this.

**Examples of good practice:** The publications from the Reproducible Research
Champions will provide other researchers with good examples of what good
reproducible research looks like.

**Support for other researchers:** The programme will capture the experience
and learning gained from making Champions' research reproducible to create a
set of resources to support other researchers in doing the same. Being able to
talk to researchers who have already gone through the process at the drop-in
sessions will also help other researchers in making their own research
reproducible.
