# Call for Turing Reproducible Research Champions

**Application deadline:** Sunday 25th February 2018

**Application link:** https://goo.gl/forms/n8ngxsawxQotq6nA2

All too often research is published as "Trust me, I'm a scientist": there is no
way for the reader to confirm the results that are presented.

We (Research fellow [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/kirstiej) and
lead research software engineer [Martin O'Reilly](https://github.com/martintoreilly))
want to make it the norm to share data and code alongside the written manuscript.
We want work published by Turing researchers to be regarded as a gold standard
example for data science, advancing the boundaries of what we know by providing
all the necessary evidence to verify those findings.

## What is Reproducible Research?
Reproducible research is work that can be independently verified. In practice it
means sharing the data and the code that were used to generate research
results. Without the evidence of what was done, journal articles are simply
nice, interesting stories. All readers, not just collaborators or the original
authors, must be able to check published research.

For the Turing, reproducibility ensures that the wider academic, industry and
governmental communities we operate in can easily validate, replicate and build
on the work we produce. This helps us extend the Turing's impact beyond the
immediate outputs of the institute itself, providing a "force multiplier" effect
on the progress of Data Science in the UK and beyond.

With an increasing focus on the scientific "reproducibility crisis" by the
[academic](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)
and [popular](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39054778) press, as
well as by [government](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/inquiry6/),
ensuring that the Turing takes a leadership role in making research reproducible
is more important than ever.

## What is a Reproducible Research Champion?

We're looking for Turing researchers who want to take their research to the
next level in terms of reproducibility and help us establish a culture of
reproducible research at the Turing.

Enthusiasm for reproducible research is the most important factor. There are many
reasons that researchers who believe in reproducible research struggle to make
their research reproducible in practice, and Champions will receive significant
support from the Turing's Research Software Engineers to overcome these barriers to
make one of their recent papers into a great example of reproducible research.

As well as generating great examples of reproducible research, the programme
will capture the learning from making Champions' research reproducible as a set
of resources to support other researchers in doing the same. We will also run a
series of face to face drop-in sessions where research engineers and Reproducible
Research Champions will provide hands on support and advice to other researchers
at the institute to help them make their own research reproducible.

## What’s in it for the champions?

**RSE time:** Each Champion will receive **2-4 weeks of RSE support** from
one of the Turing's Research Software Engineers (RSEs). The RSE will do most of
the work required to make your paper reproducible, but they will need some time
from you to answer questions about your methods, code and data, and to help
troubleshoot any issues they have reproducing your results.

**Publicity:** The Turing Communications team will work with you to publicise
your work as part of a widespread and high-profile publicity campaign
highlighting reproducible research best practice at the institute.

## What’s in it for the Turing?

**Impact:** One of the Turing's goals is to increase the impact of data science
research and ensuring that the institute's research reproducible is a key
part of this.

**Examples of good practice:** The publications from the Reproducible Research
Champions will provide other researchers with good examples of what good
reproducible research looks like.

**Support for other researchers:** The programme will capture the experience
and learning gained from making Champions' research reproducible to create a
set of resources to support other researchers in doing the same. Being able to
talk to researchers who have already gone through the process at the drop-in
sessions will also help other researchers in making their own research
reproducible.

## What will be asked of me as a champion?

**A paper:** You must have a paper you want to make reproducible that
is either published or submitted for publication (pre-prints count).

**Methods, data and code:** You must be happy for the detailed methods, data and
code associated with your paper to be made available to other researchers, and
ideally the public at large. We understand that not all data can be made
publicly available for a range of reasons such as ethics, data protection,
data ownership etc. Working out how to make research maximally reproducible in
these scenarios is an important part of reducing the barriers to more widespread
reproducibility, so if you are keen to be a Reproducible Research Champion but
have restrictions on making data available, ask a question on the
[#reproducible-research Slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR) or email [Kirstie Whitaker](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk) or [Martin O'Reilly](mailto:moreilly@turing.ac.uk).

**Time:** You will need to provide some time to support:

- The RSE working to ensure your paper is reproducible by answering questions about
your methods, code or data, and helping to troubleshoot any issues they have
reproducing your results. This will require a few hours a week for up to 4 weeks
sometime during April, May or June. **[8-16 hours total]**
- The capturing of learning from the programme as a set of resources to support
other researchers to make their research reproducible. This will require your attendance
at one or two review sessions after all Champions' papers have been
made reproducible, as well as some time to review and provide feedback on the
resources produced. **[8-12 hours total]**
- Attending a subset of the reproducible research drop-in sessions to help other
researchers in making their own research reproducible. **[6-10 hours total]**
- The publicity campaign highlighting reproducible research best practice at the
Turing. This will require writing a popular summary for your paper and
contributing to publicity material such as blog posts, articles and interviews.
**[2-4 days total]**

## How do I apply?

Applications should be submitted via the short [online application form](https://goo.gl/forms/n8ngxsawxQotq6nA2) by **Sunday 25th February 2018**.
The form should take less than 30 minutes to complete.

It asks for a few sentences (around 200 words) about why you want to be a Reproducible Research Champion
and for you to upload or link to your paper plus the supporting data and code.

***There is no need to make any effort to improve or tidy up your data or code,
as we expect to do this as part of the programme.***

We strongly suggest getting in touch with the team to have an informal
discussion about your publication, methods, data and code before you make your
application. You can do this via the
[#reproducible-research Slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR)
or by emailing [Kirstie Whitaker](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk) or
[Martin O'Reilly](mailto:moreilly@turing.ac.uk).
