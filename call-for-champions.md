# Call for Turing Reproducible Research Champions

**Application deadline:** Friday 23rd February 2018

## What is a Reproducible Research Champion?
We're looking for Turing researchers who want to take their research to the
next level in terms of reproducibility and help us establish a culture of
reproducible research at the Turing.

Enthusiasm for reproducible research is the most important factor. There are many
reasons that researchers who believe in reproducible research struggle to make
their research reproducible in practice, and Champions will receive significant
support from the Turing Research Engineering team to overcome these barriers to
make one of their recent papers into a great example of reproducible research.

As well as generating great examples of reproducible research, the programme
will capture the learning from making Champions' research reproducible as a set
of resources to support other researchers in doing the same. We will also run a
series of face to face drop-in sessions where research engineers and Reproducible 
Research Champions will provide hands on support and advice to other researchers
at the institute to help them make their own research reproducible.

## What’s in it for the champions?
**RSE time:** Each Champion will receive **2-4 weeks of RSE support** from
one of the Turing's Research Software Engineers (RSEs). The RSE will do most of
the work required to make your paper reproducible, but they will need some time
from you to answer questions about your methods, code and data, and to help
troubleshoot any issues they have reproducing your results.

**Publicity:** The Turing Communications team will work with you to publicise
your work as part of a widespread and high-profile publicity campaign
highlighting reproducible research best practice at the institute.

## What’s in it for the Turing?
**Impact:** One of the Turing's goals is to increase the impact of data science
research and ensuring that the institute's research reproducible is a key
part of this.

**Examples of good practice:** The publications from the Reproducible Research
Champions will provide other researchers with good examples of what good
reproducible research looks like.

**Support for other researchers:** The programme will capture the experience
and learning gained from making Champions' research reproducible to create a
set of resources to support other researchers in doing the same. Being able to
talk to researchers who have already gone through the process at the drop-in
sessions will also help other researchers in making their own research
reproducible.

## What will be asked of me as a champion?
**A paper:** You must have a paper you want to make reproducible that
is either published or submitted for publication (pre-prints count).

**Methods, data and code:** You must be happy for the detailed methods, data and
code associated with your paper to be made available to other researchers, and
ideally the public at large. We understand that not all data can be made available
in a completely open manner for a range of reasons such as ethics, data protection,
data ownership etc. Working out how to make research maximally reproducible in
these scenarios is an important part of reducing the barriers to more widespread
reproducibility, so if you are keen to be a Reproducible Research Champion but
have restrictions on making data available, ask a question on the
[#reproducible-research Slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR) or email [Kirstie Whitaker](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk) or [Martin O'Reilly](mailto:moreilly@turing.ac.uk).

**Time:** You will need to provide some time to support:
- The RSE working to ensure your paper is reproducible by answering questions about
your methods, code or data, and helping to troubleshoot any issues they have
reproducing your results. This will require a few hours a week for up to 4 weeks
sometime during April, May or June. **[8-16 hours total]**
- The capturing of learning from the programme as a set of resources to support
other researchers to make their research reproducible. This will require your attendance at one or two review sessions after all Champions' papers have been
made reproducible, as well as some time to review and provide feedback on the
resources produced. **[8-12 hours total]**
- Attending a subset of the reproducible research drop-in sessions to help other
researchers in making their own research reproducible. **[6-10 hours total]**
- The publicity campaign highlighting reproducible research best practice at the
Turing. This will require writing a popular summary for your paper and
contributing to publicity material such as blog posts, articles and interviews.
**[2-4 days total]**

## How do I apply?

Applications should be sent to [Kirstie Whitaker](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk) by **Friday 23rd February**. These should
include:
- A short explanation of why you would like to be a Reproducible Research
Champion (no more than half a page).
- A link to or copy of the paper you would like to make reproducible.
- A link to or copy of the data supporting the paper. This should include a short
description of how you used the data and any restrictions there may be on making the
data publicly available to all. There is no need to make any effort to tidy up or
improve the data, as we expect to do this work as part of the programme.
- A link to or copy of the code supporting your paper. This should include a short
description of how you used the code in generating the paper and any restrictions
there may be on making the code publicly available to all. There is no need to make
any effort to tidy up or improve the code, as we expect to do this work as part of the programme.

We strongly suggest getting in touch with the team to have an informal discussion
about your publication, methods, data and code before you make your application.
You can do this via the
[#reproducible-research Slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR) or by emailing [Kirstie Whitaker](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk) or [Martin O'Reilly](mailto:moreilly@turing.ac.uk).
