# Reproducible Research Lunches

**When:** Every Friday from 1pm to 2pm
**Where:** Jack Good meeting room

Starting from tomorrow - Friday 12th January - research fellow Kirstie Whitaker
and head of research software engineering Martin O'Reilly will be hosting
weekly informal lunch time drop in sessions to discuss anything (and everything)
related to reproducible research.

All too often research is published as "Trust me, I'm a scientist": there is no
way for the reader to confirm the results that are presented. Kirstie and Martin
want to make it *really easy* for all members of the Turing to provide the 
evidence for their work (the data and code that generates their results) along 
with their publications.

At the lunches you can ask questions about how to document and test your code,
how to share data that can not be made publicly available, how to version control
your work, hear about what the research software engineering team can do to make
your lives easier, and discuss the challenges you see in making your research 
reproducible. Or just come along with your lunch and listen to learn more!

**Everyone is welcome, there's no need to sign up or register.** If you can't join
on Friday lunchtimes, you're very welcome to email Kirstie (kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk)
or Martin (moreilly@turing.ac.uk) or ping them a message in the 
[#reproducible-research Slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR).
