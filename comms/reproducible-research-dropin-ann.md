# Reproducible Research Lunches

**Where:** Mary Shelley/Isaac Asimov meeting rooms (second floor)

**When:** Every other Monday, 1-2pm

Research fellow Kirstie Whitaker, lead research software engineer Martin O'Reilly and research data scientist Louise Bowler host fortnightly informal lunch time sessions to discuss anything (and everything) related to reproducible research.

All too often research is published as "Trust me, I'm a scientist": there is no way for the reader to confirm the results that are presented. We want to make it *really easy* for all members of the Turing to provide the evidence for their work (the data and code that generates their results) along with their publications.

Each of the lunches will be themed around a challenge you see in making your research reproducible, or a tool or technique that will make your life easier. You can bring your laptop along to the session to try things out as we go along, or just come along with your lunch and listen to learn more!

Everyone is welcome, there's no need to sign up or register. If you can't join on Monday lunchtimes, you're very welcome to email Kirstie (kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk), Martin (moreilly@turing.ac.uk) or Louise (lbowler@turing.ac.uk) or ping them a message in the [#reproducible-research Slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR).


## 2019 Schedule

We're kicking off this term's activities with a ***pizza party*** hosted by [The Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)! Join us on Tuesday 15th January at 4:30pm to catch up with the latest news about the project, share your suggestions and, of course, eat some delicious pizza :pizza: :yum:. Everyone is welcome, but it would be really helpful for catering purposes if you could sign up [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Nueao35HhVC01IAW2).

Our regular ***lunchtime talks*** will get started on Monday 28th January, with Kirstie leading a session about FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable - data.
You can see the full term's schedule below - look out for next month's talks from our guest speakers Stephen Eglen and Paolo Missier.

Suggestions for future sessions are always welcome - get in touch with Kirstie, Martin or Louise via email or [Slack](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR). We also have a few slots remaining in March and April if you'd like to run a session yourself.
