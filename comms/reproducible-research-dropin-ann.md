# Reproducible Research Lunches

**Where:** Mary Shelley/Isaac Asimov meeting rooms (second floor)

**When:** Every other Monday, 1-2pm

Starting from next Monday 15th October, research fellow Kirstie Whitaker, lead research software engineer Martin O'Reilly and research data scientist Louise Bowler will be hosting fortnightly informal lunch time sessions to discuss anything (and everything) related to reproducible research.

All too often research is published as "Trust me, I'm a scientist": there is no way for the reader to confirm the results that are presented. We want to make it *really easy* for all members of the Turing to provide the evidence for their work (the data and code that generates their results) along with their publications.

Each of the lunches will be themed around a challenge you see in making your research reproducible, or a tool or technique that will make your life easier. You can bring your laptop along to the session to try things out as we go along, or just come along with your lunch and listen to learn more!

Everyone is welcome, there's no need to sign up or register. If you can't join on Monday lunchtimes, you're very welcome to email Kirstie (kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk), Martin (moreilly@turing.ac.uk) or Louise (lbowler@turing.ac.uk) or ping them a message in the [#reproducible-research Slack channel](slack://channel?team=Turing&id=reproducible-research).

## Autumn 2018 Schedule

Suggestions for future sessions are always welcome - get in touch with Kirstie, Martin or Louise via email or [Slack](slack://channel?team=Turing&id=reproducible-research).
