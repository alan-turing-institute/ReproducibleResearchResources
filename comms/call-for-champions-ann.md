## Call for Reproducible Research Champions

Research fellow Kirstie Whitaker and lead research software engineer Martin O’Reilly are looking for Turing researchers who want to take their research to the next level in terms of reproducibility and help us establish a culture of reproducible research at the Turing by becoming a [Reproducible Research Champion](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ReproducibleResearchResources/blob/master/champions/call-for-champions.md).

Champions will receive significant support from the Turing's research software engineers to make one of their recent papers into a great example of reproducible research, as well as support from the Turing communications team to publicise their work as part of a campaign highlighting reproducible research best practice at the institute. Enthusiasm for reproducible research is the most important factor. There are many reasons that researchers who believe in reproducible research struggle to make their research reproducible in practice and we will help you to overcome these barriers as part of the programme.

To learn more about the benefits of being a Reproducible Research Champion, what it involves and how to apply, see the [call for applications](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ReproducibleResearchResources/blob/master/champions/call-for-champions.md). The deadline for application is Sunday 25th February 2018. For answers to questions or to discuss the research you’d like to make reproducible as a Champion, please email Kirstie (kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk)
or Martin (moreilly@turing.ac.uk) or ping them a message in the
[#reproducible-research Slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/C6XEYUQPR).
