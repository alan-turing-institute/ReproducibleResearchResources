# FAQ: Open Access

A one stop shop* for links to answers about all your Open Access questions.

### HEFCE Open Access Requirements

All outputs that can be considered for REF 2021 must be open access.

### Archiving in your institutional repository

If you're a member of a university, you should upload your author accepted version to your institutional repository.

* University of Cambridge repository: https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk
  * Guidance: https://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-research/share-your-research

🚧 ***add links to the partner university repositories*** 🚧

### Archiving for non-university members of the Turing

If you are not a member of a university, you still want to make sure your publication is open access, and REF compliant.

We don't know exactly what these options look like

We could host our own repository such as DSpace (originally developed by MIT and HP; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSpace) or Invenio (originally developed by CERN; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invenio).

* ✅ Pros: we control it and we can brand it clearly.
* ❌ Cons: we are responsible for it! Why bother to host when we can use another one? Would we add in all the university publications? If no the the repository will always seem to be be quite empty.

We could upload additional outputs to Zenodo (https://zenodo.org) or Figshare (https://figshare.com).

* ✅ Pros: standard repositories, widely used and stable ***if HEFCE compliant***
  * See this blog post for more information on why, for example, arXiv is not HEFCE compliant https://unlockingresearch-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=488
* ❌ Cons: no branding, maintains the problem that all outputs are in different places.
